** Ideas

Continue using the mechanics from Crazy Golf Cart for something delivery related.

Many people will make food or mail delivery based games. Try to do something more original.

*** Car delivery?

Where you deliver different cars to people across town.
- Would need to implement getting in and out of vehicles
  

*** Towing game.

Vehicles break down in the town and you have to use a tow truck to bring them to the yard
- May have finicky joint mechanics
